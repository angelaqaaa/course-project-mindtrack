## **Installation Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Java 11 or higher** (JDK 11 minimum as per Maven configuration)
- **Maven 3.6+** for build management
- **Git** for version control
- **4GB RAM minimum** (8GB recommended for optimal performance)

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lininnin/csc207-proj.git
cd csc207-proj
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Install all Maven dependencies
mvn clean install

# Skip tests during installation (optional)
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

### **Step 3: Configure OpenAI API (Optional)**
For AI analysis features, set environment variable:
```bash
# Set OpenAI API key as environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Or set system property when running
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="app.RunApp" -DOPENAI_API_KEY=your-key

# Alternative: Set as JVM system property
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="app.RunApp"
```

*Note: AI features will be disabled if no API key is provided. The application uses gpt-4o-mini model.*

### **Step 4: Build and Run**
```bash
# Compile the application
mvn compile

# Run the main application
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="app.RunApp"
```

### **Common Installation Issues**

**Java Version Conflicts**
```bash
# Check Java version
java -version
# Should show 11+ (17 recommended)

# Set JAVA_HOME if needed
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java11+
```

**Maven Build Failures**
```bash
# Clear Maven cache
mvn dependency:purge-local-repository

# Force update dependencies  
mvn clean install -U
```

**Windows-Specific Issues**
- Ensure proper PATH environment variables
- Use `mvn.cmd` instead of `mvn` if needed
- Run command prompt as Administrator if permission issues occur

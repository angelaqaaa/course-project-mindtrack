## **Project Overview**

### **Purpose**
MindTrack is a mental wellness tracking application that correlates daily tasks, daily events, and goals with wellness metrics to help users understand the relationship between their activities, productivity, and mental wellbeing. Through AI-powered analysis, users can identify patterns and receive personalized recommendations for optimizing their wellness and productivity.

### **What Problem Does It Solve?**
Many people struggle to understand the connection between their daily activities and their mental wellness. MindTrack bridges this gap by:
- **Tracking daily tasks and events** alongside wellness metrics
- **Identifying patterns** between activities and mood, stress, energy levels
- **Providing AI-powered insights** for better decision-making
- **Offering personalized recommendations** for improved wellness and productivity

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: Java Swing GUI with Clean Architecture
- **Backend**: Java 17 (compatible with Java 11+) with Maven build management
- **Storage**: Local JSON file storage (no cloud sync)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API for pattern analysis
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with SOLID principles (4 layers: Entity, Use Case, Interface Adapter, View)

## **Installation Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Java 11 or higher** - [Download JDK](https://adoptium.net/) (JDK 11 minimum as per Maven configuration)
- **Maven 3.6+** - [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) for build management
- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control
- **4GB RAM minimum** (8GB recommended for optimal performance)

### **System Compatibility**
- **Operating Systems**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, Linux Ubuntu 18+
- **Architecture**: x64 systems (Intel/AMD 64-bit)
- **Network**: Internet connection required for AI analysis features

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/angelaqaaa/course-project-mindtrack.git
cd course-project-mindtrack
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Install all Maven dependencies
mvn clean install

# Skip tests during installation (optional)
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

### **Step 3: Configure OpenAI API (Optional)**
For AI analysis features, set environment variable:
```bash
# Set OpenAI API key as environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Then run the application
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="app.RunApp"

# Alternative: Set inline with run command
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="app.RunApp"
```

*Note: AI features will be disabled if no API key is provided. The application uses gpt-4o-mini model.*

### **Step 4: Build and Run**
```bash
# Compile the application
mvn compile

# Run the main application (recommended method)
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="app.RunApp"

# Alternative: If you experience font rendering issues, run through IDE
# Open src/main/java/app/RunApp.java in your IDE and run directly
```

### **Common Installation Issues**

**Java Version Conflicts**
```bash
# Check Java version
java -version
# Should show 11+ (17 recommended)

# Set JAVA_HOME if needed
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java11+
```

**Maven Build Failures**
```bash
# Clear Maven cache
mvn dependency:purge-local-repository

# Force update dependencies  
mvn clean install -U
```

**Font Rendering Issues**
```bash
# If you see garbled text or missing characters when running via Maven:
# 1. Try setting system properties
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="app.RunApp" -Dswing.defaultlaf=javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel

# 2. Alternative: Run directly from IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse)
# This typically provides better font rendering

# 3. On Linux systems, install additional fonts
sudo apt-get install fonts-dejavu-core fonts-liberation
```
![Installation Process](images/installation-demo.png)

**Windows-Specific Issues**
- Ensure proper PATH environment variables
- Use `mvn.cmd` instead of `mvn` if needed
- Run command prompt as Administrator if permission issues occur

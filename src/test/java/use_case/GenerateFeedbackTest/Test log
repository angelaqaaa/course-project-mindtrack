Test 1 - general test for functionality, yay it worked!
Analysis: The week shows a significant gap in productivity data on 2025-07-27, with no tasks scheduled, completed, or overdue, indicating a potential lack of engagement or activity. This absence of data may correlate with lower productivity levels observed on adjacent days, suggesting a possible trend of reduced task completion or scheduling. The lack of wellness and events data further supports the notion of inactivity on this day, which may contribute to overall wellness decline if such patterns persist. The absence of data could imply a break in routine or external factors affecting productivity and wellness. However, without data from the other days, definitive correlations cannot be established.

Notes: Data for 2025-07-27 is MISSING.
Correlation: Schedule at least three tasks for each day next week to ensure consistent engagement and productivity. Incorporate wellness activities, such as a daily walk or mindfulness session, to enhance overall well-being. Review your calendar at the start of each day to prioritize tasks and maintain focus. Consider setting reminders for both work and wellness activities to prevent gaps in your routine. Reflect on any external factors that may have contributed to last week's inactivity and address them proactively.

Test 2 - figured out we didnt have enough tasks everyday to do bayesian analysis.
Analysis: The report indicates a complete lack of task data, wellness logs, and events for both July 26 and July 27, 2025. This absence of data suggests a potential disruption in productivity and wellness tracking during this period. The consistent zero entries across both days may indicate a broader trend of inactivity or disengagement, possibly correlating with external factors not captured in the report. The missing data could imply a lack of scheduling or prioritization of tasks, which may affect overall productivity in the following days. However, without additional data points, these remain assumptions.

Notes: Data for July 26 and July 27 is MISSING.
Correlation: Prioritize scheduling at least three key tasks for each day next week to regain focus and productivity. Implement a daily wellness log to track your physical and mental health, aiming for at least one entry per day. Set aside time for reflection at the end of each day to evaluate your progress and adjust your plans as needed. Consider identifying potential external factors that may impact your engagement and address them proactively. Finally, commit to a consistent routine that includes breaks to maintain energy and motivation.
Recommendation: {
  "effect_summary": [
    {"variable":"stress","direction":"none","confidence":0.0},
    {"variable":"energy","direction":"none","confidence":0.0},
    {"variable":"fatigue","direction":"none","confidence":0.0}
  ],
  "notes": "Insufficient data to determine effects due to missing values."
}

Test 3 - prompt fix for analysis
Analysis: Throughout the week, there appears to be a correlation between the number of completed tasks and average wellness changes, suggesting that higher task completion may be associated with improved wellness. However, the absence of data on 2025-07-27 disrupts the ability to fully assess these trends, as it may indicate a potential drop in productivity or wellness that could align with lower task completion on adjacent days.

Test 4 - prompt fix for analysis
Analysis: The week shows a pattern of fluctuating productivity, with some days exhibiting higher task completion rates correlated with increased wellness levels, while other days show a decline in both areas. The absence of data on 2025-07-27 may indicate a potential drop in productivity or wellness for that day, as it lacks any recorded tasks or wellness assessments, which could suggest a disconnect from routine or engagement.


Test 5 - so why does it say 2 different days missing?
Analysis: Throughout the week, the completion rate for tasks remained consistent at approximately 66.67%, indicating a stable level of productivity despite fluctuations in wellness metrics; higher stress and fatigue levels on days with a 'Stressed' mood correlate with lower energy levels, while 'Happy' moods align with lower stress and fatigue, suggesting a potential relationship between emotional state and productivity outcomes.

Notes: Data for wellness levels on July 22 is MISSING, which may indicate a gap in understanding how the initial mood and wellness levels influenced productivity trends on subsequent days.
